## Lab 08: OO Design

Problem summary:

se the file recentquotes.json to show random popular book quotes. Your program should use GSON to parse the .json file. The app needs no functionality other than showing the quote and the author when it is run. The app should choose one quote each time it is run.

so whatâ€™s interesting here?

The interesting parts of this lab are:

How do I use GSON?
What class(es) should I write to encapsulate this functionality?
How does the App class use the class(es) I write?
How do I test this functionality?



## Directions for testing:
Use JUnit to write at least one test for each of the Feature Tasks.
